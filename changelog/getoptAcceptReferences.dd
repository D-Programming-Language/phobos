Allow std.getopt to accept out pameters by reference

Previously get opt takes the "receivers" for options as pointers,
which will be assigned with `*receiver = parsedValue`.  This change allows
the caller to pass those parameters by reference instead.  Basically, this
allows code to delete the `&` before variable names when calling getopt
-------
bool opt;
string[] args = ["program", "-a"];
//previously required passing &opt
getopt(args, config.passThrough, 'a', opt);
assert(opt);
