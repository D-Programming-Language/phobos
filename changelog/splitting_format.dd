Module `std.format` has been split into smaller modules

The module `std.format` has been split into submodules:

$(UL
    $(LI `std.format.spec`: Symbols concerning the format string, mainly
         the `struct FormatSpec` and the `template singleSpec`)
)

All public symbols are still accessible using std.format as usual.

$(I Please note: The splitting process is still underway, more modules
will be split off in the near future.)
