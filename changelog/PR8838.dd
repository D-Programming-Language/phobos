isBasicType!T now returns false for enum types

In the language spec, a basic type is defined to be one of `void`, `bool`, a
built-in integer type, a built-in character type, or a built-in floating-point
type.

Prior to this release, `isBasicType!T` returned `true` when `T` was either a
basic type, or an `enum` type whose base type was a basic type. Now, it returns
`false` for all `enum` types, and only returns `true` if `T` itself is a basic
type.
