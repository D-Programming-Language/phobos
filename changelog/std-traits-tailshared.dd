`TailShared` was added to `std.traits`

$(REF TailShared, std, traits) changes a type's qualifiers such that its tail is shared, but its head isn't.

---
import std.traits;

static assert(is(TailShared!int == int));
static assert(is(TailShared!(int*) == shared(int)*));
static assert(is(TailShared!(shared int**) == shared(int*)*));
