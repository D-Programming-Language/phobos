New module `getpass` in `std`

A new module `getpass` has been added to `std`. It exposes one
function, `getpass`, which reads a password from the current terminal
without echoing it, similarly to how Glibc handles passwords:
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getpass.3.html

```
string password = getpass("Please input your password: ");
```
