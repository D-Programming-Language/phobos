`std.typecons.Nullable` will return true for `isNull` on objects initialized with null

The following behavior for nullable is changed:
---
Nullable!Object n = null;
assert(!n.isNull); // old behavior
assert(n.isNull);  // new behavior
---
This applies to classes, interfaces, pointers and dynamic arrays.
