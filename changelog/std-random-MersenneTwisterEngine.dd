`MersenneTwisterEngine` has been updated so that its template signature matches the C++11 standard.

`MersenneTwisterEngine` has been updated so that its template signature
matches the C++11 standard (adding two new template parameters, an extra
tempering parameter `d` and the initialization multiplier `f`).

Handling of the word size `w` has been fixed so that the generator will
now properly handle cases where it is less than the number of bits in
the chosen `UIntType`.  This has been validated against the behaviour
of a widely-used implementation of the C++11 standard.

For anyone using the standard template instantiation `Mt19937` this will
have no noticeable effect.  However, these will be breaking changes for
anyone using the `MersenneTwisterEngine` template directly.

The internal implementation has been reworked to use Ilya Yaroshenko's
highly optimized algorithm from `mir.random`.  This should have a very
noticeable positive effect for anyone who cares about generating a lot
of random numbers quickly.

A new `Mt19937_64` template instantiation has been added, corresponding
to the standard 64-bit implementation of the algorithm (MT19937-64).
This fixes $(LINK https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10900).
