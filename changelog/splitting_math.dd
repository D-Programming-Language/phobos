Module `std.math` has been split into smaller modules

The module `std.math` has been split into submodules:

$(UL
    $(LI `std.math.trig`: Trigonometric functions)
)

All public symbols are still accessible using `std.math` as usual.

$(I Please note: The splitting process is still underway, more modules
will be split off in the near future.)
