Fixed comparison bug in `std.algorithm.comparison.levenshteinDistance`

Previously the algorithm was allocating the amount of memory which was equal to
the size of the biggest range, that is $(BIGOH max(s.length, t.length)).
This is now fixed to be $(BIGOH min(s.length, t.length)).
For more details see $(REF levenshteinDistance, std, algorithm, comparison).
