Added `toBytes` property to `std.bigint.BigInt`

Added a `toBytes` property to `std.bigint.BigInt`, which converts the `BigInt`
to a sequence of bytes that represents the native-endian representation of
that number.

Also added an `opCast` operator for converting `BigInt` to `ubyte[]`, which
just calls the `toBytes` method and returns the result.
